# Code First Girls Nanodegree

This repository contains the homework I completed as part of the Code First 
Girls Nanodegree. I am in the process of adding all of the classwork I undertook 
as part of the course as well.

## About the Nanodegree

The Code First Girls Nanodegree is a 12-week intensive evening course with the 
option to specialise in either software or data. The course is split into two 
halves—the foundation and the specialisation.

The foundation part of the course is split into three sections:
* Python basics
* SQL basics
* Concepts

This is followed by the specialisation. I took part in the software 
specialisation.
