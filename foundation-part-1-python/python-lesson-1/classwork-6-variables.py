"""Python Session 1 Classwork Exercise 6 - Variables

Note we did not cover Exercise 5 on errors and casting objects into different 
types in class."""

# DEMO

# Watch demo on variables

# A variable is a reusable label for a data value.
# Creating/assigning a variable has three parts:
# 1. The variable's name
# 2. An equals sign
# 3. The data value it references

# Values and variable are interchangeable.
# A variable can be put anywhere that a data value can be used.

# We are defining the variables:
username = "Jenny_1995"
age = 23

# We are creating a print statement using the newly created variables:
print("The person with the username", username, "is", age, "years old.")

# We want to print the word "spaghetti":
print("spaghetti")

# We want to asign the word spaghetti to the variable food and then print the 
# word:
food = "spaghetti"
print(food)
