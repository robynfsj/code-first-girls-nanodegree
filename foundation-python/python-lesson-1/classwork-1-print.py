"""Python Session 1 Classwork Exercise 1 - Print Function"""


# DEMO
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Learn how to create a new file and then run this file.


# QUESTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Now that you've run your first program, try the following:
#
# print("Is everyone still following us?")
#
# - Change the message to anything you want
# - Repeat the code on multiple lines to output several messages
# - Find out what happens when you remove different parts of the code
#   (e.g. brackets)
# - Don't worry if something unexpected happens. Think about what you changed
#   and why it might have caused it to happen.


# SOLUTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
print("Is everyone still following us?")
print("Hello, my name is Robyn.")
print("Hello world!")
